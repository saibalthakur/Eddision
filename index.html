    <h4>
        Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 â€“ October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman who has been
        described as America's greatest inventor.[1][2][3] He developed many devices in fields such as electric power
        generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures.[4] These inventions, which include the
        phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread
        impact on the modern industrialized world.[5] He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of
        organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He
        established the first industrial research laboratory.[6]

        Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired
        some of his earliest inventions.[4] In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New
        Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He later established a botanic laboratory in Fort
        Myers, Florida in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a laboratory in West
        Orange, New Jersey that featured the world's first film studio, the Black Maria. He was a prolific inventor,
        holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered
        six children. He died in 1931 of complications of diabetes.
